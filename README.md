# OpenAI Browser Chat Extension

This browser extension allows users to engage in natural language conversations with OpenAI's powerful language models. The extension features a chat interface where users can input prompts and receive real-time responses, leveraging OpenAI's API to generate contextually relevant and engaging text.

Designed for ease of use and extensive customization, users can enter their OpenAI API key and select their preferred language model and parameters. This enables them to tailor the conversational experience to their specific needs and use cases.
